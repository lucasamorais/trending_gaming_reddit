1lxjf05;2025-07-11;"Debated whether to post the sale or not since this is an early access sale exclusive to PlayStation Plus members only, though should be hitting the store for everyone this coming week.

However, the games discounted in this sale and the price reductions are some of the best I've seen in a while.

Silent Hill 2, Elden Ring, Oblivion Remastered, Dead Space, even GTA 5 and Red Dead 2 are deeply discounted. I think some of the games here are at their lowest I've ever seen on PSN, which is saying something.

Notable Games Worth Checking Out

* **EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ 25 Standard Edition PS4 & PS5 (-25% $14.69)**¬†\- The only soccer sim available, so it's not like you have a choice. The next iteration should be out very soon, so might be better to wait for that one.
* **Assassin's Creed Shadows (-25%, $52.49) -** Latest Assassin's Creed game that got a lot of good scores. First time on sale on PSN.
* **Forza Horizon 5 (-25%, $44.99) -** Microsoft's former Xbox-exclusive racer that reviewed well. Getting a steady stream of support.
* **TES 4: Oblivion Remastered (-20%, $39.99)** \- The lowest it's been on PSN so far, this is Bethesda's remaster that's more like a remake of the epic RPG. If you need a game that will take hundreds of hours of your time, this is it.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)** \- This is the lowest it will ever be on PSN. It‚Äôs been on sale before, and this is the lowest it‚Äôs ever been. If you‚Äôre one of the two people that still do not own this, then this is your chance.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2 (-75%, $14.99)** \- I think this is the lowest I've ever seen this on PSN. Definitely pick this up. Arguably Rockstar‚Äôs best open-world game to date. Loads of Easter eggs, fantastic story, and just packed with stuff. Highly recommend this even if you don‚Äôt like westerns. This is the lowest it‚Äôll ever get on PSN, so if you‚Äôre on the fence about that, here‚Äôs your answer.
* **Dragon Ball Sparking Zero (-30%, $48.99)** \- The lowest it's been on PSN. Latest Dragon Ball fighting game, and is the most recent entry in the Budokai series. Insane amount of fighters.
* **Mortal Kombat 1 (-67%, $16.49)** \- Definitely the lowest I've ever seen on PSN. Just the base game and doesn't include the DLCs, though that version is also discounted.
* **Elden Ring (-40%, $35.99)** \- FromSoftware's most popular work, rarely goes on sale. So pick this up if you've been thinking about it.
* **Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (-20%, $55.99)** \- MachineGames' former Xbox exclusive. Insanely fun. Has that Indiana feel and has loads of puzzles and secrets.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-75%, $14.99)** \- Lowest I have ever seen this on PSN. The PS4 version is even cheaper. This is a fun open world game based on the Harry Potter universe. I‚Äôve said this before, but saying it again: your body count here would make Lucious Malfoy blush.";debated whether post sale since early access sale exclusive playstation plus members though hitting store everyone coming week however games discounted sale price reductions best ive seen silent hill elden ring oblivion remastered dead space even gta red dead deeply discounted think games lowest ive ever seen psn saying something notable games worth checking ea sports fc 25 standard edition ps4 ps5 25 1469 soccer sim available like choice next iteration soon might better wait one assassins creed shadows 25 5249 latest assassins creed game got lot good scores first time sale psn forza horizon 25 4499 microsofts former xboxexclusive racer reviewed well getting steady stream support tes oblivion remastered 20 3999 lowest psn far bethesdas remaster thats like remake epic rpg need game take hundreds hours time gta 50 1999 lowest ever psn sale lowest ever youre one two people still chance red dead redemption 75 1499 think lowest ive ever seen psn definitely pick arguably rockstars best openworld game date loads easter eggs fantastic story packed stuff highly recommend even dont like westerns lowest itll ever get psn youre fence heres answer dragon ball sparking zero 30 4899 lowest psn latest dragon ball fighting game recent entry budokai series insane amount fighters mortal kombat 67 1649 definitely lowest ive ever seen psn base game doesnt include dlcs though version also discounted elden ring 40 3599 fromsoftwares popular work rarely goes sale pick youve thinking indiana jones great circle 20 5599 machinegames former xbox exclusive insanely fun indiana feel loads puzzles secrets hogwarts legacy 75 1499 lowest ever seen psn ps4 version even cheaper fun open world game based harry potter universe ive said saying body count would make lucious malfoy blush;0.9273;Positivo;266

It sounds like it's still in really bad shape and as a completist not being able to do things as simple as kill major story bosses.

Packed with new Easter eggs, new combat sections and just an amazing experience. Should have been a contender for GOTY or at least won a few awards.

* **Sea of Thieves (-50%, $19.99)** \-  Rare‚Äôs former Xbox exclusive. Pirate game that has a healthy player base, and gets live service support.
* **GTA The Trilogy Definitive (-60%, $23.99)** \- ¬†Not sure how performance is now, but three GTA games for that price? You‚Äôll be playing this one well into 2025.

* **Civilization 7 (-15%, $59.49)** \- First time this is on sale, if I'm not mistaken? Latest strategy game in the franchise. Getting a ton of support.
* **Tekken 8 (-50%, $29,99)** \- This might underwhelm fight fans compared to Tekken 7, but it‚Äôs still a solid fighter. Loads of support but characters locked behind a paywall.
* **Battlefield 2042 (-90%, $5.99)** \- People love to crap on BF2042, but it is in a better place now. No more seasonal content but still lots of events, patches etc. At that price and with all the updates implemented? Worth a shot for sure. Go ham on Redacted and enjoy it. This is the lowest it's been on PSN.

* **Final Fantasy 7 Remake + Rebirth Twin Package (-43%, $56.99)** \- Insane deal if you're looking to get into the first two remakes before the third drops, which won't be for a long time.
* **The Witcher 3 (-80%, $7.99)** \- If The Witcher 4 trailer got you hyped, go jump in. Even if you‚Äôre not familiar with the first two games, it‚Äôs fine. One of the best games of all-time. Has fantastic side quests, loads of weapons and armor to scavenge for. If you haven‚Äôt played this yet, I cannot recommend this enough. With The Witcher 4 announced, this is the perfect time to dive into Geralt‚Äôs world.

* **RoboCop: Rogue City (-85%, 8.99)** \- Better than expected. Brings familiar RoboCop visuals and violence. I‚Äôm actually surprised this turned out as well as it did.
* **The Quarry (-86%, $9.79)** \- Supermassive's narrative-driven cinematic games. This one has kids camping and then horror hits.
* **Atomic Heart (-60$, 27.99)** \- It‚Äôs like BioShock but with less polish and less interesting story. Final DLC already released.
* **Dead Space (-80%, $13.99)** \- One of the best remakes ever. It‚Äôs a travesty that we still haven‚Äôt gotten confirmation of a remake of Dead Space 2. This improves the original in every way, and I can‚Äôt stress enough how awesome this game is. The vibe and atmosphere Motive has made when you walk corridors and see shadows?

* **Visions of Mana (-40, $35.99) -** Action RPG and is the fifth mainline entry in the Mana series. Mostly got favorable reviews when it was released.
* **Nobody Wants to Die (-60%, $9.99)** \- detective game not an action title. Reminds me of Minority Report minus Tom Cruise (is that good or bad?).
* **Eiyuden Chronicle Hundred Heroes (-65%, $17.49)** \- Old school RPG and a surprise hit. Still getting support. Reviewed quite well. If you need another JRPG fix, this might be it.
* **Alien Isolation The Collection (-75%, $9.99)** \- Horror game where you're not a space marine, sequel in development. Underrated horror game. This includes the DLCs.
* **Final Fantasy 7 Remake (-50%, $14.99)** \- The first part of the remake, and is a perfect example to show your kids how this game was the biggest thing back then
* **Deathloop (-80%, $11.99)** \- One of Arkane's finest works and implements time travel without being annoying.
* **LA Noire (-50%, $19,99) -** Rockstar‚Äôs detective game. Slower paced than your usual action game, so don‚Äôte expect moment-to-moment gunfights. More deliberate but offers something new. Not getting a remaster or remake soon, so worth a shot for now.

1ik5b5g;2025-02-07;"This was replying to a now deleted comment.  I had fun with the game so heres some quick thoughts. 

It's really 3 games in 1. You can ignore the main storyline mostly and just explore, hunt, trade with clans. Basically a fairly chill experience. There are a lot of clan side quests and tasks and additional story.

You can play it like a stealth game. Infiltrate mining sites taking everyone out 1 by 1 and never getting spotted and earning higher quality equipment as well.

Or 3rd you can play it full agro and be a 1 man...Avatar army. Play through the main story, quickly max a bow and shotgun and just straight up destroy the humans. It's a lot of fun jumping, climbing, sliding around a base taking everyone out. 

It's not perfect but I got a solid 70 hrs out of it without the dlc. The bad is some of the side quests and collectables are boring and long. Like doing a memory painting. Crafting is also overly complicated and not fully useful. Just find the good recipe and stick with it. Same with weapons.

In the end it is a Far Cry game. They always get repetitive but I found the Pandora world a lot of fun to explore and clean up.";replying deleted comment fun game heres quick thoughts really games ignore main storyline mostly explore hunt trade clans basically fairly chill experience lot clan side quests tasks additional story play like stealth game infiltrate mining sites taking everyone never getting spotted earning higher quality equipment well 3rd play full agro manavatar army play main story quickly max bow shotgun straight destroy humans lot fun jumping climbing sliding around base taking everyone perfect got solid 70 hrs without dlc bad side quests collectables boring long like memory painting crafting also overly complicated fully useful find good recipe stick weapons end far cry game always get repetitive found pandora world lot fun explore clean;0.9733;Positivo;34

A lot of people couldn't recover it because they may haven't typed the right info so they had to phone customer service, and it wasn't necessarily a given you could recover your account, based on the info you had.

I was part of these people, somehow I was getting an error message when trying to get back my password, so I had to phone customer service. Guy on the phone, probably in his twenties, he was familiar with the issue and very cool guiding me. He made me tell some of my info to verify my identity checked, but when I told him my birthdate, he said ""hmm there's a mistake"". So I repeated it, said it was my genuine birthdate and he said something like ""there's a wrong digit"", then he gave me hints what it could be just to help me out, and turns out I had put the wrong year in my account. 

I was sure I had created my account back when I got my PS3 with MGS4 but turns out I only reused the same account I had created a couple years back on my PSP, when I was a minor, so I changed the birth year to be able to create an adult account, since I didn't want to create a minor account and get restricted functions.

Shout out to the customer service guy, I'm pretty sure he wasn't meant to help me like that if I gave the wrong info, especially when my account had made up infos in it, but I guess he had enough info to confirm my identity and also I kinda pleaded my case with the fact my account had a lot of games bought and played.

However, the games discounted in this sale and the price reductions are some of the best I've seen in a while.

Silent Hill 2, Elden Ring, Oblivion Remastered, Dead Space, even GTA 5 and Red Dead 2 are deeply discounted. I think some of the games here are at their lowest I've ever seen on PSN, which is saying something.

Notable Games Worth Checking Out

* **EA SPORTS FC‚Ñ¢ 25 Standard Edition PS4 & PS5 (-25% $14.69)**¬†\- The only soccer sim available, so it's not like you have a choice. The next iteration should be out very soon, so might be better to wait for that one.
* **Assassin's Creed Shadows (-25%, $52.49) -**¬†Latest Assassin's Creed game that got a lot of good scores. First time on sale on PSN.
* **Forza Horizon 5 (-25%, $44.99) -**¬†Microsoft's former Xbox-exclusive racer that reviewed well. Getting a steady stream of support.
* **TES 4: Oblivion Remastered (-20%, $39.99)**¬†\- The lowest it's been on PSN so far, this is Bethesda's remaster that's more like a remake of the epic RPG. If you need a game that will take hundreds of hours of your time, this is it.
* **GTA 5 (-50%, $19.99)**¬†\- This is the lowest it will ever be on PSN. It‚Äôs been on sale before, and this is the lowest it‚Äôs ever been. If you‚Äôre one of the two people that still do not own this, then this is your chance.
* **Red Dead Redemption 2 (-75%, $14.99)**¬†\- I think this is the lowest I've ever seen this on PSN. Definitely pick this up. Arguably Rockstar‚Äôs best open-world game to date. Loads of Easter eggs, fantastic story, and just packed with stuff. Highly recommend this even if you don‚Äôt like westerns. This is the lowest it‚Äôll ever get on PSN, so if you‚Äôre on the fence about that, here‚Äôs your answer.
* **Dragon Ball Sparking Zero (-30%, $48.99)**¬†\- The lowest it's been on PSN. Latest Dragon Ball fighting game, and is the most recent entry in the Budokai series. Insane amount of fighters.
* **Mortal Kombat 1 (-67%, $16.49)**¬†\- Definitely the lowest I've ever seen on PSN. Just the base game and doesn't include the DLCs, though that version is also discounted.
* **Elden Ring (-40%, $35.99)**¬†\- FromSoftware's most popular work, rarely goes on sale. So pick this up if you've been thinking about it.
* **Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (-20%, $55.99)**¬†\- MachineGames' former Xbox exclusive. Insanely fun. Has that Indiana feel and has loads of puzzles and secrets.
* **Hogwarts Legacy (-75%, $14.99)**¬†\- Lowest I have ever seen this on PSN. The PS4 version is even cheaper. This is a fun open world game based on the Harry Potter universe.

* **Atomic Heart (-60$, 27.99)**¬†\- It‚Äôs like BioShock but with less polish and less interesting story. Final DLC already released.

* **Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake (-35%, $38.99)**¬†\- First time this is on sale. Reviewed very well and if you haven't played the Dragon Quest games before, this might be a good starting point.
* **Gotham Knights (-85%, $10.49)**¬†\- Arkahm meets Bat Family. No support for this, but might be worth a play for Batman fans just to see the various combos and moves for each character.
* **BioShock The Collection (-80%, $9.99)**¬†\- Another value-for-money bundle. BioShock 1 has one of the most memorable stories I‚Äôve ever played.

1b771xa;2024-03-14;"I lost access to all my games and apps on December 11th 2023. Each would ask me to download/buy the game again even though it was installed. I had also bought 2 battle passes days prior which I could no longer access/complete.

I had an hour long phone call with PS Support and all that was confirmed was that I had tried all their solutions before phoning them. Ended the phone call being told my case would be sent to the specialist team. The specialist teams first response was to factory reset the PS5 which changed nothing and lost everything I couldn't backup.

After 3 MONTHS and very bad communication, they asked me repeatedly to restore my liscenses. All previous attempts showed around 33 liscenses and never fixed the problem.

On the 6th March 2024, after being asked again to restore liscenses yet again, there were 678 liscenses to restore and now everything seems OK- at least for the past week.

I had gone through so many forums and articles about these issues, and despite first mention of it being 3 years ago, for this issue to persist for all users and for a duration of 3 months for a fix is just shoddy. 

I asked them what they done to fix it so if it happens again I can refer them to my case with the fix but they won't share the info.

I'm currently trying to get compensation for 3 months missed PS plus after paying their new subscription increase to ¬£60 a year on December 6th 2023. They've offered me ¬£15.

I declined and asked for a better compensation and they come back to offer ¬£15 again. I've now asked my case to be sent to higher management for a better compensation offer and will be chasing them tomorrow if I don't hear back today.

The whole process has been very annoying with very bad communication, sometimes weeks without a word other than the copy and paste response to confirm they're looking into it. For a problem that existed 3 years ago, no one should be waiting more than 3 days for a fix.

1b771xa;2024-03-10;"A few updates, for anyone following:

1. More users are having the issue fixed. u/ArkJK had their account restored a month to the day after losing access (shortest confirmed fix time I'm aware of). They confirmed that initially Sony offered no compensation, but after being pressed for it Sony gave them a code for one month of PS+ Premium [""as a gesture of goodwill.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationSupport/comments/1b4xlag/comment/ku05hv7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) In my opinion, that's bare minimum in terms of compensation for this, and pretty disappointing.
2. Some users have been starting to receive more tangible timelines. u/CosmicYeen [was told 3 to 4 days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1b771xa/comment/ktyic0m/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) u/Gold-Biscotti-7391 [was told 10 days.](https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1b771xa/comment/ku6w407/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Those timelines are far shorter than what people have actually been experiencing, and hopefully a sign that Sony is accelerating their process of addressing this.
3. This makes sense and probably won't come as a surprise to anyone, but physical copies of games you've purchased digitally do work normally. I wondered if they would, just on the chance that there was some account level block with these games, but I tried it last night with borrowed physical copies of two of my digital games and both worked normally, including DLC that I had for Gran Turismo 7.

**And lastly,** u/Gold-Biscotti-7391 [**reported that**](https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1b771xa/comment/ku6w407/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **extending your PS+ subscription by a month could restore your access to the PS+ catalog, and in my case it did work. Immediately after extending, my ""Purchased"" games list expanded to improve every title I'd ever redeemed on PS+, both Catalog games and Monthly games. I tried a few of those PS+ catalog and monthly games that were previously inaccessible and they work now. Cloud saves appear to be functioning normally for me as well. Still have padlocks on all of the games I actually did purchase, but PS+ at least seems to be fully restored after extending.** 

**I want to emphasize that YMMV on this, as** u/Gold-Biscotti-7391 **mentioned it being a bit finicky with some games they tried still not cooperating.** u/CosmicYeen **also ran into some issues including with games that they had purchased that were also in the PS+ catalog, detailed in** [**this comment**](https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1b771xa/comment/ku9cn9q/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**.** u/ArkJK **also added some valuable information on this that is worth checking before attempting this** [**in this comment.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1b771xa/comment/ku95yxr/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) **So if this experience hasn't totally soured your taste for Sony, adding a month to your Plus membership may an instant way to regain access to some, if not all, of those PS+ games.

We were able to continue playing the game that day.  A few days later when we wanted to continue, I noticed the game was ""locked"" and it asked me to purchase it again.

I started a PS Support live chat about the issue and the agent said it's probably because it's still stuck on the old PS Plus license and he is escalating it to the proper team, and that they would contact me in 5-7 business days.  7 business days later, I contacted them again and they said to keep waiting.  This continued 2 more times, until I decided to just wait 2 more weeks.

1b771xa;2024-03-24;"Update for those following: Haven't heard from Sony yet (would be surprised if I do before tomorrow), but I wanted to share two unusual things I did with my console/account in the last 24 hours on the very slim chance that I somehow accidentally fixed my account myself.

\----------

1) The first thing I did was yesterday afternoon, I created a throwaway account on my console to try to unlock the licenses for Rocket League and Brawlhalla. Once I added them to the library of the throwaway account, my main account could play them again via Console Sharing. After adding them (but before playing) I did try restoring licenses on my main just in case that did something, and nothing changed. BUT after doing that, I played a bit of Brawlhalla and I didn't try to restore again or look at my library on my phone until this morning, as I detailed in my latest update. Did launching that previously locked game fixed my account? I'd say it's far from impossible, given how weird this bug is.

So, exact sequence of events, if anyone want to give it a try:

\- created throwaway account

\- added Rocket League and Brawlhalla to my library (I would think you could do this with any free-to-play game you're locked out of)

\- tried to restore licenses (this did nothing)

\- played Brawlhalla

If you try doing this with a free-to-play game you're locked out of, what I would recommend is going through these steps, launching the game on your main, and then restoring licenses again after launching the game. It probably won't do anything, but again I think it's at least a possibility that this fixed my account.

\----------

2) The second unusual thing I did was configure my Apple TV for remote play with the free app MirrorPlay, which required me to authenticate my login credentials. I did this today, minutes before I realized my account had been fixed. I think it's far less likely this is what fixed my account - I'm guessing it was already fixed when I did this and I hadn't realized it yet. But, throwing it out there for anyone who wants to give it a try.

\----------

If anyone does give these a try, please reply and let me know whether it did or did not work for you. If by some miracle one of these things actually did fix my account and does the same for you, I'll edit my main post with the solve. Fingers crossed.";update following havent heard sony yet would surprised tomorrow wanted share two unusual things consoleaccount last 24 hours slim chance somehow accidentally fixed account first thing yesterday afternoon created throwaway account console try unlock licenses rocket league brawlhalla added library throwaway account main account could play via console sharing adding playing try restoring licenses main case something nothing changed played bit brawlhalla didnt try restore look library phone morning detailed latest update launching previously locked game fixed account id say far impossible given weird bug exact sequence events anyone want give try created throwaway account added rocket league brawlhalla library would think could freetoplay game youre locked tried restore licenses nothing played brawlhalla try freetoplay game youre locked would recommend going steps launching game main restoring licenses launching game probably wont anything think least possibility fixed account second unusual thing configure apple tv remote play free app mirrorplay required authenticate login credentials today minutes realized account fixed think far less likely fixed account im guessing already fixed hadnt realized yet throwing anyone wants give try anyone give try please reply let know whether work miracle one things actually fix account ill edit main post solve fingers crossed;0.9645;Positivo;1

1b771xa;2024-03-05;"It‚Äôs not as easy as that. The only way to decouple digital purchases with licenses is to allow the company to back out some time after purchase, as is true with physical products. If consumers truly owned the product (ie, a digital copy was given to them, and they had 100% responsibility of ensuring it is never lost), while many users would be happy, others would be quite upset when they sold their console and found out they couldn‚Äôt redownload the same games.

Why is this necessary? Because every download poses a financial burden on the company. In simplest terms, if a company goes out of business, they have no way to continue providing things like redownloads, online play, etc, because those things are live services, and must be funded by other means (like PS+, in-game purchases, etc).

And none of this touches on the potential rampant piracy issues that would ensue as well (which, yes, at that scale would hurt the video game market, and in turn the consumers).

A law protecting consumers in the digital space as well as protecting companies sufficiently to encourage the market to continue existing, would be quite a hard law to draft.

Right now, the market has established a reasonable precedent for the time being, which is that companies feel obligated to not revoke digital licenses because they wish to ensure that customers continue spending money. It‚Äôs not a perfect solution, but there are much worse realities.";easy way decouple digital purchases licenses allow company back time purchase true physical products consumers truly owned product ie digital copy given 100 responsibility ensuring never lost many users would happy others would quite upset sold console found couldnt redownload games necessary every download poses financial burden company simplest terms company goes business way continue providing things like redownloads online play etc things live services must funded means like ps ingame purchases etc none touches potential rampant piracy issues would ensue well yes scale would hurt video game market turn consumers law protecting consumers digital space well protecting companies sufficiently encourage market continue existing would quite hard law draft right market established reasonable precedent time companies feel obligated revoke digital licenses wish ensure customers continue spending money perfect solution much worse realities;0.9821;Positivo;4

1b771xa;2024-03-15;"The PS Plus workarounds seem to vary quite a bit in terms of how well they work. I did this too, went from Extra to Premium, but for me it didn't seem to do anything. All of the games I had previously redeemed on PS+ were still inaccessible. Since Extra already gives you the catalog, I'm guessing that's why nothing changed for me.

But then, when I extended my subscription by a month instead, suddenly all PS+ features (including catalog and my previously redeemed PS+ games) worked completely normally. Games I actually purchased games are, of course, still locked. I know other people have tried the same thing, and it's worked the same for some of them, but for others only a handful of PS+ games or no games at all returned to working order. Very much a YMMV situation.

1b771xa;2024-04-26;"Aww, really sorry to hear that. Both for you, and for the community at large because it means they haven't actually managed to stop new cases like we were starting to suspect - assuming that you were hit in the last day or so.

Unfortunately reaching out to customer service is the only thing you really can do. You can open a case via phone or chat support, but you may have marginally better luck getting answers from phone support. You'll be told to be patient while they work on your case - a frustrating thing to hear, but it's unlikely you'll get much more than that in terms of answers or timeline. After opening a case (make sure to get the number) call back/chat again the next day and ask for the case to be escalated. With any luck you'll be emailed by their engineers within a week or so and once that happens you can be sure that they're actively investigating your account. Just to prepare you, most people have waited a month or longer to have their account repaired. Some have waited multiple months. I'm kind of a weird case, where I was never contacted by their engineers but my account was fixed 3 weeks to the day after I reported it to them. I still haven't been contacted by them. I'm not really sure what happened in my case.

At least one person managed to get a much quicker solution by filing a complaint against them with the BBB. After doing so, they were promptly contacted by Sony and their account was fixed I believe within 24 hours. It's worth a try, if it's something you're comfortable doing.

Another band-aid fix that has worked for some people is extending your PS+ subscription by one month. In my case, and for some others, this fully restored my access to all PS+ features including cloud saves. It did \*not\* restore purchased games.

3t78j6;2015-11-17;"I worked in disputes for a major credit card company for several years. I spent some time working on cases that got stuck between disputes and fraud that got F'd up every which way possible, by every person that touched the case in the credit card company. God, reading your case is going to give me nightmares, because it seemed like about one out of every four cases that got stuck between disputes and fraud was from a Sony Playstation account. 

Just to kind of explain the situation (believe me, when I worked for the credit card company, I wanted to pull my hair out just as much as you do, every time I came across a case like this), there is a difference between a fraudulent charge, and a disputed charge. Not even a lot of people at the credit card company know the difference (yes, I know, frustrating). As a rule of thumb, a fraudulent charge is one in which the person who made the charge, is someone who was not authorized to use the card. A disputed charge is one in which the charge was made by the cardholder, or someone the cardholder authorized to use the card, but the goods or services were either not delivered, or delivered in a manner not consistent with the terms agreed upon, at the time of purchase. 

Now, what has happened to you, is fraud. Someone that you did not authorize to use your card, accessed your card info (even though they didn't directly access your info, they went through a third party account which contained your card info, and used it to make unauthorized purchases). The fraud department at your credit card company should have handled this from the beginning, filed a lost stolen report, issued you a new credit card and covered your fraudulent charges, easy peasy. 

What actually happened, is that Sony, for reasons I will never fully comprehend, convinced you, the cardholder, who should NEVER have to learn all of the convoluted language involved in credit card disputes and fraud, to file a chargeback, meaning they wanted you to file a dispute. Now, by filing a dispute, what you're essentially saying is that the charge was valid, just that the services delivered were not what you expected. Sony is a huge company, so they have a dedicated chargeback department, that only responds to chargebacks. Without going into all the criteria, once the company receives the chargeback, they have to respond to the credit card company, proving that services were delivered and that they were delivered correctly. Well, when you filed a chargeback against Sony, they only had to prove that services were delivered, to win the dispute. The fact that they were fraudulent charges doesn't even enter into the equation, because it's a disputed charge, which inherently means that the charge was valid. 

Now, as far as getting your money back is concerned, your best bet would be to deal with the bank only, and convince them to get you to a fraud specialist (use my line from earlier about the person accessing your credit card info indirectly), so they can file a lost stolen report and get your charges covered. Now, if you're not worried about accessing your Sony account in the future, you will be done, but things get tricky, because Sony will ban accounts that have been charged back, and I know that a lot of people have games and such on there that they paid for. As far as regaining access to your Sony account, you'll have to deal with Sony, and I don't have any advice for doing that.

My bank gave me this bit of advice - never use your debit card online, use a credit card.  The reason is that with debit, the fraudulent charges have already cleared and actual money was lost.  With credit, you can dispute the charges and not be out of that money.

3t78j6;2015-11-17;"The blatant problem here and with just about every ""cloud based"" gaming service, is the fact that they can and will ban your account the second you, the consumer, asks for a charge-back with your credit company. Guilty until proven innocent, the consumer is ALWAYS wrong. 

Putting my **TL;DR** here to save the majority from the following wall of text: Consumers really need more rights and protections when it comes to games and files in general saved on outside servers or on the cloud. There is no reason a consumer should have to fear losing their entire library when they've been wronged by the company or their accounts have been compromised. No one should have to worry about losing sometimes thousands of dollars in digital content because of a legitimate charge-back, sometimes as small as single dollar.

----

That said, if you want to read my story, here it is:

----

I was once very involved in a certain gaming community (I will never mention their name again because I refuse to ever give them any kind of attention again, positive or negative). I had literally spent $1000 in purchases for this game in less than a year just because A) at the time, I believed in the devs and thought I was helping the community and game that I enjoyed so much at the time and B) they weren't ""pay to win"" purchases but more along the lines of things like skins and extra storage space. 

However one day, I bought a ""key"" that unlocked a specific area of the game (actually, a common area, unless you want to play it alone and give yourself a slightly better chance at better loot) for **$1** and my connection timed out as I was waiting for that dungeon to load.

I proceeded to go through support and calmly ask for a replacement key, or at least my single dollar bill be refunded to me. Nope! I explained how I had been a loyal customer for 2 years and had spent over a thousand dollars on that game alone in the past year. Their response? They accuse me of trying to scam them out of a single dollar, after I had spent literally over $1k in the game in *less than a year*. So I did charge-back and of course, next thing I know, I'm banned from my account. By this point, I was so in shock and disgusted by the chain of events that had led to this point, I chalked it up as a lose and honestly, I'd have probably never played the game again anyways out of principle alone.

3t78j6;2015-11-17;"This will be buried, but I'll say my piece because I had some success.
I purchased a Vaio laptop to the tune of around $1150, including the extended warranty etc.
Around 2 months in, the case began to unglue, only unsightly, not a mechanical malfunction or anything (relavent). About 6 months later, an entire 2 columns of pixels died on the left side of the screen. I notified sony and brought the computer to an actual Sony store where I was told ""no problem, we will send the computer in and you'll have it back within 2 weeks.""
As the employee said, I received a call that their repair facility received it and estimated repair time of about 7 days. I was stoked regarding the expeditious service.
I waited for 2 weeks from the call without a word, then began calling about the repair status. Maybe they had to order extra parts, shipping took longer, sent it back to the store, etc. As a student, I was concerned.
Ultimately, after a week and a half, and probably 10-12 hours of phone-time, of working through Sony customer service, I found out that Sony never actually sent the claim to the warranty company (or the warranty company never responded... still don't know). Spent another week relaying the warranty info between the two departments.
I was contacted saying due to the glue loosening, it voided my entire warranty and it would cost extra to fix. I figured why not, I just needed my computer. I was told I would receive a call within 48 hours to explain and charge me if I decided to proceed, otherwise they would just send it back as-is. I never got a call, and the day I was supposed to be called, the computer arrived at my door via ups.
Upon opening the package, the computer was heavily damaged and parts of the case were cracked and there were plastic pieces in the UNDAMAGED and untampered ups box that were no longer attached (case entirely broken in places).
I called to file a claim and was told that since the computer was damaged when I sent it in for repairs, they couldn't complete the claim despite photos of before handing Sony the computer and after receiving it back.
After several more attempts, I called Sony USA corporate, office of the CEO. Spoke to his assistant and briefly explained the situation in about 30-45 seconds leaving out any interaction issues, using just facts. I received a call back from another executive, I believe it was the customer service exec, and gave him the same 30-45 second summary.
Was refunded the full price of the computer and was given an additional Sony gift card as a good - will gesture.

Tl;Dr
Call Sony usa corporate, office of the ceo and calmly (and without thereats etc) explain the facts in a 30-45 second elevator pitch. Answer any questions they have, provide any relavent info (leaving out any emotional issues or encounters with Sony staff). Leave contact information with them!

All it takes for them to ""win"" that round is to say ""I want to dispute this chargeback."" I used to be a chargeback analyst and would have to file these disputes all day long. The coding that they spoke about is a chargeback reason code. Unauthorized charges gave different criteria than fraudulent charges. Either way, easy for the merchant to basically just say it was valid at this point.

The next stage is arbitration (without knowing what brand of card it is, this isn't absolutely true). Your bank can send a rebuttal back saying that they still dispute the charge. This causes the merchant to be notified and send their rebuttal. Then a arbitrator from the card company (Think Visa/Mastercard) makes a decision on the case. Visa has always been a little more card holder friendly so hopefully your card is with them.

Anyway, good luck.

I work for and Australian bank so usually against the Aussie branch of PSN, so not sure if US PSN process differently, but Visa Scheme rules for this type of transaction are pretty standard across the different Visa regions. 
I think you issue here is with the bank filing your chargeback incorrectly. Recurring/subscription type transactions always have chargeback rights. If filed as unauthorised; the merchant has to provide documentation or compelling evidence that indicates you participated in the transaction. This means a signature on a contract/invoice etc. If Sony's re presentment (reply to chargeback) doesn't include a signed document your bank can still press for pre-arbitration as they can indicate the rep-docs do not satisfy the chargeback requirements. 
If your bank did file the wrong reason code and lost the disputed because of that there is no second chance with visa. I'd file a formal complaint with your bank regarding the handling of your chargeback. 
I honestly would say with 99% confidence I would have recovered your fund were you a cardholder with my bank. Someone at your bank messed up.

It also says he is waiting to hear back from his bank again. This seems like a case that he has to deal with the bank and not Sony. If your CC gets stolen you don't take the places that money was spent at to court. Instead you work it out with the bank that has your CC.

So, why should he be dealing with Sony instead of his bank?

EDIT: Per /u/WigWubz personal experience:

>In my own very recent experience (my Amazon account got hacked two days ago and 1000 euro in gift cards sent to some unknown email address with a PO box in England) I was told by my bank that since I had legitimate business with Amazon in the past, I had technically authorised the company to withdraw funds from my bank account and therefore as the funds had been transferred from my account into theirs, it was all completely legal and there was nothing the bank could do short of a proper chargeback.

EDIT2: To the many talking about account bans due to chargebacks, I agree that this is bullshit and I don't know how/why it is legal. If /r/gaming wants to take that to court I fully endorse it because it seems like an unjustified banning and is a worrying trend for digital purchases that removes consumer protection. However, taking them to court over the fraudulent charges makes no sense at all. If your account is hacked, it got hacked. Unless there is a physical security device to protect your account (like an authenticator) it is impossible to guarantee with any certainty that your account is safe.

3t78j6;2015-11-17;"In the banks defense, which would really apply to any bank used here not just BofA, the reason listed on the charge back was Unauthorized Purchase instead of Fraud which this situation truly is. You should easily win your fraud chargeback claim.

Think about this logically. The reason provided accuses Sony that they charged you for something they didn't properly disclose to you. The responses they gave (likely canned responses) show the controls they have in place to ensure they did disclose everything to you as well as controls to ensure the purchase wasn't accidental. That's why the bank didn't accept the charge back. This would be the outcome at  *any bank*.

Now that you've filed under the fraud reason, the entire case will be handled differently. Think about this logically. With the first reason, you are blaming Sony for something and asking them to admit fault and make you whole. Admitting fault where none occurred immediately stops the act of making you whole and also represents damage to Sony by admitting fault. This is *bad* for Sony. With Fraud you are blaming an unknown 3rd party for something and asking Sony to bear the cost as a normal part of doing business. When Sony makes you whole, that's perceived as a *good* thing since Sony is the big company with the big pockets and you are the innocent victim.

As the cardholder here, you don't care as long as you get your money. And I agree with you. The unseen piece here is how this impacts *everyone* involved including Sony. If you were a business owner, you would not publicly and on permanent record damage your own brand by admitting fault when it wasn't yours to begin with. That's logical, reasonable, and that's all that happened here. Now imagine you get thousands of these requests a day, many of which are fraudulent themselves. If your policy was so loose that you just paid everyone, you'd be hemorrhaging money. That's not good either. That's why Sony's response was what it was.

You're doing the right thing by refilling.

For clarity, I'm only looking at this from the Bank's perspective. I'm actually not a fan of Sony for the very reasons you describe and refuse to do business with them. The rigmarole you went through sounds like nobody has the authority to do anything for you and it's unacceptable to me, along with their history of privacy breaches.

3t78j6;2015-11-18;"It's been a couple of years, but it's all coming back to me.

For Visa and MasterCard, the issuing bank has to pay a fee for each chargeback it initiates, to either Visa or MC. It would be different for Amex and Discover, since they issue their own cards. The company I worked for issued Visa and MC cards. There are also costs, such as labor associated with each chargeback. The fee is to keep banks from filing chargebacks without merit, since it is in Visa and MC's best interest to keep the merchants happy also, so that they continue to accept Visa and MC as payment. 

Once the merchant receives the chargeback, they can either just accept it, or they can re-present the charge to the bank. I believe there is a fee associated with that as well, to keep re-presentments in check, just like chargebacks. 

I never heard of the bank increasing processing fees for merchants for filing chargebacks. Even if that were the case, it would be Visa or MC increasing those fees, and not the bank. The issuing bank has to comply with all of Visa and MC's guidelines in order to use their symbol. In the case of the other 2, I'm not sure.

Thought it would be more CoD like or stealth shooter rather than tactical team based shooter. So eventually I traded it in during a GameStop bonus offer.

But I know that there's an increase in popularity lately and a friend's been playing it so I decided to give it a shot. I think it was on PS+? I didn't have to buy it, it was just in my library.

My main worry was that I would get wrecked every single round due to the player base having played since launch.

I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure a tiny learning curve to get back into it and find a few operators you like, but I am shocked at how well I'm doing with how little I've played since starting up again.

Especially not as strong as Mafia1DE, but apart from those minor tech issues and maybe a few minor other things here and there I have still really enjoyed it so far. Had it in the library for some time and been playing for a few days.  

Story is supposed to be strong, and so far I can concur at least. But Lincoln is very much a power fantasy type of character in comparison to the other Mafia protagonists. And it's less linear giving you the option to do certain things in the order you choose.


Gameplay is said to be kinda repetitive and grind heavy, and I agree, but I don't mind it too much, as the combat and shooting is pretty fun. Maybe I'll finish it some other time when I get tired of it, but I do that with most games anyway. There is A LOT more to do than in the other games. Much more arcade like where you do ""go here kill/destroy/steal thing and come back to NPC"" type missions. It's just a lot more ""videogamey"" in general.   

The radio and music is a real strong point tho. Late 60s was an amazing time for music. Bangers only on the radio whatever channel you choose. The setting in general is pretty great imo. Beautiful cars too

There's only one correct spot on the board, so if you miss it by a little, it's try again. I don't know why they didn't just allow you to auto-complete those sections. It just feels like a boring time sink and slows down the momentum of the game.

It;s a cool idea to have the Board so you can look over things that happened earlier, (like if you had to put the game down for a couple weeks, it would help refresh your memory) but having to build it is slow and tedious.";found mystery board sections really irritating forced put pictures notes cork board go details things experienced dont place exactly right spot move back hands slowly try theres one correct spot board miss little try dont know didnt allow autocomplete sections feels like boring time sink slows momentum game cool idea board look things happened earlier like put game couple weeks would help refresh memory build slow tedious;0.0055;Neutro;2

I'll recommend some JRPGs that are currently on sale:

 ‚Ä¢ Persona 5 Royal (PS5, -60%, $23.99) ‚Äì One of the best JRPGs from the last generation, now with 4K 60fps support on PS5. Highly recommended for newcomers or anyone interested in turn-based games.

‚Ä¢ DRAGON QUEST XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age ‚Äì Definitive Edition (PS4, -50%, $19.99) ‚Äì A classic JRPG with a great story. It's one of my favorite Dragon Quest games alongside VIII.

‚Ä¢ Yakuza: Like a Dragon (PS4/PS5, -50%, $9.99) ‚Äì A fantastic deal considering the amount of playtime you get for the price.

‚Ä¢ Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch Remastered (PS4, -80%, $9.99) ‚Äì If you love Studio Ghibli films, give this game a try.

‚Ä¢ Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of DANA (PS5, -50%, $19.99) ‚Äì A fun action RPG with great button-mashing combat and an engaging story. A nice entry into the Ys franchise.

‚Ä¢ Ys IX: Monstrum Nox (PS5, -40%, $29.99) ‚Äì Similar to Ys VIII, though the story isn't as good Ys VIII. However, I prefer the characters in this one.

‚Ä¢ TALES OF BERSERIA (PS4, -50%, $9.99) ‚Äì A Tales game I really enjoy, alongside Arise and Abyss.

In the second one I spent a bunch of time between missions trying to earn money, then immediately there was the next part of the story where I lost everything. So treat it more like a story game than a big open world game.

But the remastered versions are really good and they do some clever things like when you're driving around, these road signs appear with an arrow like left or right turn which point you to wherever you're navigating, then disappear as you drive by them.

16b0chq;2023-09-26;"To me it doesn't make any sense that free games have multiplayer enabled out of the box and expensive paid games do not have it.

* Free-To-Play online games (like Warzone) tend to have a lot more online traffic than paid games (like Elden Ring or Dark Souls 3) and they don't charge anything for online play.
* Sony/Microsoft charges the people that paid an expensive game (like the 80‚Ç¨ Diablo 4) and extra 72‚Ç¨ yearly to be able to play it online for 12 months.

They should release some really cheap plan to cover for the online multiplayer services and maybe 100MB or 1GB for storing the save files (optional to be honest..) maybe 12‚Ç¨ per year.

The truth is, probably most of the players with PS Subscription ""Essentials"" don't care about 95% of the stuff they pay for and they just pay it to get the multiplayer feature and Sony/Microsoft take advantage of this.

Personally I'm going to use my (new) PS5 for pure offline gaming. And if there is a paid game I want to play online (like Elden Ring, Modern Warfare 3, etc) I'd just buy it on my PC with Steam and connect it via HDMI to the TV if I want to play it on the big screen.

But I would totally buy some games like Elden Ring or MW3 on the PS5 if they didn't have this 72‚Ç¨ subscription.

On the bright side, this makes the game developers focus more on the single player features than the multiplayer features. It mainly impacts games that have some nice multiplayer feature (We could say that Sekiro is spared. Elden Ring not spared, MW3 is definitely not spared).";doesnt make sense free games multiplayer enabled box expensive paid games freetoplay online games like warzone tend lot online traffic paid games like elden ring dark souls dont charge anything online play sonymicrosoft charges people paid expensive game like 80 diablo extra 72 yearly able play online 12 months release really cheap plan cover online multiplayer services maybe 100mb 1gb storing save files optional honest maybe 12 per year truth probably players ps subscription essentials dont care 95 stuff pay pay get multiplayer feature sonymicrosoft take advantage personally im going use new ps5 pure offline gaming paid game want play online like elden ring modern warfare etc id buy pc steam connect via hdmi tv want play big screen would totally buy games like elden ring mw3 ps5 didnt 72 subscription bright side makes game developers focus single player features multiplayer features mainly impacts games nice multiplayer feature could say sekiro spared elden ring spared mw3 definitely spared;0.9708;Positivo;1

2ueeak;2015-02-01;"Not really in Sony's interest, and I'll tell you why.

The point of PS+ Isn't really to make Sony a lot of money (at least right now.)

It gives you a good deal on PS3 games (albeit with several downsides compared to owning outright). However it also gives you PS4 and Vita games. So if you have just a ps3 right now, you have all these games for your PS3. But you have all these games for a PS4 and the vita.

Black Friday is comin around, and you're looking to ditch your PS3 (maybe not ditch, just make it one of your legacy systems). What do you go with? A gaming PC? An xbone? A ps4? 3ds? vita? Well, with the PS4 and Vita you have a library of games already, and if you get the ps4 you're not really going to cancel your ps+ service, anyways. Those games add value to the systems, and if you're deciding between a PS4 and XBone, the PS4 becomes a lot more appealing.

So the PS+ model kind of assumes you're going to get a next-gen console and play online with that, because its structured right now to build brand loyalty so you do exactly that. Microsoft missed this whole point with xbox live, since they were only really in it for the money, not to secure sales and market share for this new gen.";really sonys interest ill tell point ps isnt really make sony lot money least right gives good deal ps3 games albeit several downsides compared owning outright however also gives ps4 vita games ps3 right games ps3 games ps4 vita black friday comin around youre looking ditch ps3 maybe ditch make one legacy systems go gaming pc xbone ps4 3ds vita well ps4 vita library games already get ps4 youre really going cancel ps service anyways games add value systems youre deciding ps4 xbone ps4 becomes lot appealing ps model kind assumes youre going get nextgen console play online structured right build brand loyalty exactly microsoft missed whole point xbox live since really money secure sales market share new gen;0.9461;Positivo;43

The weapons are fun to shoot. The environments are beautiful and diverse enough for me so far. I got to Venus, and the Rift. Speaking of, I enjoyed the cinematic for. The facial expressions they made for  the Awoken warlock I used really impressed me for some reason. It felt pretty smooth and realistic the way the Guardian and Ghost shared glances, expressing emotion in their different ways.

The Multiplayer was fun too, but I don't recommend playing it at a low level unless you have a weapon that feels very comfortable. I started doing well when I found a pistol that did 99 damage, fired faster that any other I had found yet, and had 4 rounds. Two to the face, or three to the body and they're down. It was great.

With steamworks integrated games, it also allows you to join the games and servers that your friends are playing on, and send invites to friends to join your game. Not all games are integrated however.

I personally pay zero attention to people's steam profiles most of the time, and nobody seems to give a damn about achievements, but steam gives every game a community hub page which can host discussions, community made guides, videos, reviews, and recently, live twitch style broadcasts, all accessible and producible in the steam client.

I can't compare community features with consoles because honestly I have only ever played on my brothers console, or some friend's console, and I've never had a paid console online service subscription, but I find the community features on steam very helpful.

The user written guides have been invaluable to me, and I also know that often when a developer releases a game that is not up to scratch (filled with bugs or missing promised features, or just a con), the steam reviews pick up on it pretty quickly, and its all there to see on the community hub discussions.

Then there's always the steam workshop, the best way ever to distrebute community made modded content.

https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-kids-safety-grey-world-of-key-selling.html

The very short answer is a key can only be as cheap as the lowest possible deal that the official retailer has ever had.

PS Plus is region specific, and the deals on CD keys are substantially below any Region‚Äôs deals over the year. CD keys doesn‚Äôt get deals direct from PlayStation, so there‚Äôs only one other way to get the price that low, and it‚Äôs pretty common. Stolen credit card info used to buy a few keys, sell them to CD Keys or another grey hat for cheap, and CD Keys can resell them without a paper trail of a crime committed.

Not to say everything on CD Keys is like that, for some games like many on steam people just buy a ton of keys during a big sale and resell them for slightly more over the year.

llj8g9;2021-02-17;"I only played for a few hours but I found the combat janky at best. The first boss you fight throws projectiles at you, except you can't see them coming, (literally not rendered, or move too fast) and then you get hit and slaggered/knocked down. Oh also basically any time you get hit you'll be staggered and momentarily lose control of your character. As for story/politics stuff, most of what I'm about to mention is stuff I've read in reviews.

The game is a weird mix being pro colonialism and also anti colonialism, anti religion (the ""totally not protestants"" faction is evil and racist, not that some members are and some are not), and anti science (human experimentation, again, the faction is bad, not the members), and *very* pro capitalist. The only faction that doesn't have negative consequences associated with its storyline is the merchants guild. 

The premise of the game is population density and resource draining cause a plague, so you set sail to the ""totally not Noth America in the 1700s"", and go to this resource rich island. But because it's an RPG, your main goals end up being to... gather every resource you can see and build up your faction's presence on the island.

For some reason the island natives (referred to as savages multiple times in the first hour of the game) are 100% peaceful with no conflicts between the different tribes on the island, (this plays into a common trope of ""Noble Savages"") and also are all treated collectively as a single faction. Because your character is a colonists, with no option to play as an island native, the player ends up being the broker of peace between everyone, with the natives praising you for bringing peace. Which again, are a collection of tribes who HAVE ACHIEVED TOTAL HARMONY with each other, but can't do that with outsiders for some reason?

Again, I stopped playing before getting to the island so I didn't see first hand a lot of the stuff mentioned above.

On a practical sense, including that would slow the pace of the fight, potentially rendering useless the stagger mechanics (which requires an active and aggressive approach at all times), and it's through staggering that most of your damage will be dealt. So you would either need to re-do the whole core gameplay, or engage with a nightmare in terms of balancing out the fights. Also, many old FF games and other turn based RPGs had bosses/enemies that would require a complete do over to your party or grinding so you could beat them (take the Shin Megami Tensei titles for instance). Status ailments (like confusion, blind, stone and so on) were a big part of that and on later portions of those games, they would end up becoming actual puzzles. I have no problem with that, but it's a different approach that I feel fits better turn based combat than fast paced action rpgs.;mechanical standpoint cant see could jive current gameplay foundation practical sense including would slow pace fight potentially rendering useless stagger mechanics requires active aggressive approach times staggering damage dealt would either need redo whole core gameplay engage nightmare terms balancing fights also many old ff games turn based rpgs bossesenemies would require complete party grinding could beat take shin megami tensei titles instance status ailments like confusion blind stone big part later portions games would end becoming actual puzzles problem different approach feel fits better turn based combat fast paced action rpgs;-0.7096;Negativo;-4

At the time, PS5's were still a rare find in stores. I found myself so busy with work and the projects I was working on that I, to this date, haven't played a single game on it yet. Dont get me wrong, my work projects were also my hobbies (do what you love and you'll never work, or something). But now it's been just over 2 years and I'm finally ready to put some serious hours on the console. I think after the first few months of not using the PS5, I somehow subconsciously convinced myself to not play any games on it until FF7R2. I was pretty close to playing FF16 this past holiday season, but after coming back from taking my family on vacation, I realized I wouldnt have enough time to get through the entire storyline before returning to normal work hours. So, I didn't even try. I'm excited to dive back into the world of Mako and re-experience the wonder that I felt when I put that first disc into my PS1 and saw Aeris for the first time. Through memories and trailers, I kind of know what to expect now, but I also avoided re-playing the original just so I could fully enjoy this remake as though it was my first time experiencing the story.

1b2ozx8;2024-03-01;"The Zack scene at the start of the game is a parallel universe, the same shown at the end of FF7:R where Zack defeats the shinra troops and doesn't die, and some members of Avalanche survived the sector 7 plate collapse. The implied events at the start of the game is Avalanche raided Shinra without Cloud, possibly with more involvement from Wutai, and shit went tits up and it seems Red XIII  and Aerith at least may have died (if not the rest of them). 

You can tell this by the fact that it was using the alt-universe Stamp mascot, seen briefly on the camera zoomout shot after the broadcaster talks. That is the signal that its the alt-universe events. 


Now the timing of stuff is clearly fucky-wucky. My best guess is in that timeline Zack and Cloud are in captivity longer, and Avalanche pushes forward with the raid and because Cloud isn't present its all jacked up. Presumably Cloud wasn't there to save Aerith from Hojo, who put her in the containment bay with Red XIII and kept them there until they were flown out of Midgar and crashed from Red XIII's attack.";zack scene start game parallel universe shown end ff7r zack defeats shinra troops doesnt die members avalanche survived sector plate collapse implied events start game avalanche raided shinra without cloud possibly involvement wutai shit went tits seems red xiii aerith least may died rest tell fact using altuniverse stamp mascot seen briefly camera zoomout shot broadcaster talks signal altuniverse events timing stuff clearly fuckywucky best guess timeline zack cloud captivity longer avalanche pushes forward raid cloud isnt present jacked presumably cloud wasnt save aerith hojo put containment bay red xiii kept flown midgar crashed red xiiis attack;-0.7169;Negativo;0

gqwv1i;2020-05-26;">A: Updates/patches will no longer need to dreaded long ‚Äòcopying‚Äô. This is because the SSD solves the need for duplicate game assets to load games faster.

Not exactly right. 

The reason why the Copying step is not necessary is because the SSD is not based on physical searching, unlike the HDD, which has an arm that reads the data from the disc that makes up the hard drive. 

This copying step was made so that all the assets in a game file would be located in the same physical space instead of being scattered all around the drive, so that you reduce the number of searching steps and thus decreasing the time to find an asset.

Same thing happens when you use defragmentation on a HDD base computer.

Duplication of game assets is another method of reducing the time needed to fin and asset but it is not directly related to the copying step.

SSDs contain all the info like a USB drive, is all software based therefore all data are instantly available and the only bottleneck is transfer speed, so  the copying step is not needed.

Hope this helps.";updatespatches longer need dreaded long copying ssd solves need duplicate game assets load games faster exactly right reason copying step necessary ssd based physical searching unlike hdd arm reads data disc makes hard drive copying step made assets game file would located physical space instead scattered around drive reduce number searching steps thus decreasing time find asset thing happens use defragmentation hdd base computer duplication game assets another method reducing time needed fin asset directly related copying step ssds contain info like usb drive software based therefore data instantly available bottleneck transfer speed copying step needed hope helps;0.9081;Positivo;46

Sorry to be a bother but this isn't exactly accurate.

Rasterization is a highly parallel process, it is true that higher clocks increase rasterization speed, but I would think that more CUs could easily make up for that.

I wouldn't say that the ps5 has more rasterization ""power"", I would say the the GPU is smaller but is tuned to be fast, while overall GPU power is higher on the series X.

Now, next-gen games may rely more on asset streaming that pure gpu processing capabilities, the series X is going to play this gen games at higher resolution/framerate than the ps5 if devs decide to harness the extra power, while next-gen games may look more detailed on the ps5 down the line.

I think it would be good to include something about the fan noise of the PS5 vs. PS4, since a lot of people seem to ask about whether the PS5 will sound like a jet engine. Since Cerney directly addressed this and said it was something Sony was prioritizing, I'd say it's safe to include that fan noise will not be an issue going forward.

It also might be worth including something about the DualSense, even if it's just a link to the blog post that breaks down the controller's features.

gqwv1i;2020-05-26;"Still a number of misleading or inaccurate things in this FAQ. For example, the statement about remastered PS1/2/3 games (remastered for PS4) working suggests that those games are somehow different from any other PS4 game. They're not. They're just as likely to work as any other native PS4 game.

The writeup also suggests that Kraken compression is a significant reason for reduced storage needs. Keep in mind that the PS4 supports ZLIB (and a purpose-built hardware decompression chip, just like PS5), which is only 10-20% less efficient than Kraken, so that gain is likely quite insignificant compared the gains from no longer duplicating assets. And the more granular/on-demand nature of installations will be significant in managing storage use.

Also the technical limitations of current m.2 drives have nothing to do with having ""12 channels"". You're confusing the architecture of the the system's proprietary memory setup with the M.2/PCI4.0 standards. They're using 12 smaller, slower chips because it's logical and cost-effective for putting in the console.  The long and short of the ""don't buy an M.2 drive yet"" should be 1. There aren't drives on the market yet that are fast enough 2. Storage costs always go down over time, so buying in advance is wasting money.

Boost mode on PS5 should be automatic and not dependent on developers.  Cerny discussed testing the top 100 most popular games.

I don't know if it in-line patches while copying or copies and then patches, but the reason for the copy step is to apply binary delta patches.

Before the PS4 had delta patching, a patch could be huge because changing one line of dialog would require replacing an entire data file, for example.   With the delta patches, a copy of the data file would be made and then patched.  This is similar to how ""IPS"" files work in the retro patching community.

The PS5 will probably operate similarly but that's just speculation.";main reason copy step apply binary delta patches instead whole new files copy whole game copying step update run copies files patched way binary patch fails original file remains dont know inline patches copying copies patches reason copy step apply binary delta patches ps4 delta patching patch could huge changing one line dialog would require replacing entire data file example delta patches copy data file would made patched similar ips files work retro patching community ps5 probably operate similarly thats speculation;0.2023;Positivo;0

CDKeys at least lists all keys under their own name. So, they are the ones buying/selling the keys, not some random anonymous person/group/business.

> they allow anyone to sell their keys

Do we allow anyone to become our seller? Yes and no. First we need to get essential information about the person (for example tax info), you can read about the whole process of verification here:  [https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-15-g2a-interview](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-10-15-g2a-interview)). 

As a safety mesure, we introduced various security features to be sure that our sellers are trustworthy. For starters: 30 days waiting period before a seller can withraw money they earned on transaction. Secondly, every person who wants to sell more than 100 keys has to have a registered business, provide us with tax and many more personal information. Our security system also uses AI to analize user's behaviour and alerts any suspicious patterns (change of credit card for example). That's just the tip of an iceberg.

> G2A sells a ""buyer protection service"" 

I'm very happy to inform you that this paid feature is long gone and has been replaced by free Money Back Guarantee to you get what you paid for without any additional fees. 

I hope I cleared some things up, and showed you that we value the transparency of our sellers. Feel free to ask me any questions.

We gotta ask ourselves. If Sony want to go all in on digital sales ONLY and kill off physical media. Then what is the point of owning a console?

Yes you can turn it on and just play games simply, but for many of us, we already have vast steam libraries full of games spanning multiple console generations. Why don't we just spend the extra and build a living room PC and be done with it? Yeah its a bit more work and setting up but IMO you're getting a far superior benefit over the life span of a console generation compared to previously. Lets say you go build a decent PC. In 7 years time providing the games still run fine, you may or may not need to upgrade anything at all! Maybe in 10 years you'll need to upgrade the GPU, CPU (providing the socket is still supported and RAM).

I think now is the time that Console based PC's are finally starting to become a proper alternative to game consoles if we are going all in on digital gaming.

1ff0pvq;2025-03-05;"PCs are much less stable than a console. There are many plus points to both im not sure why you said that though. The wide range of hardware means gaming on pc will always involve problems with stability whereas console everything is optimised development for that hardware and the console for playing the software.

im in a similar dilemma or at least i think about it every few years. I just feel the whole idea of getting a pc and upgrading.. i dont know. Is it really a big advantage? Ive gamed on high end gaming pcs vs consoles throughout life cycle and the difference between one toward the wend of its life cycle and pc gaming is so shockingly minimal unless you need twitch gaming fps or are in a strange kind of mind bubble that exists. I feel in the pc community there is a lot of reading specs rather than actually playing and seeing how much real world difference they make - just from experience with pc gamer friends. 

  
I remember playing on my friends high end pc i think iot was doom and just not being remotely impressed as it looked the same as most console shooters. Some nice reflections. But meh. He kept looking thinking id be blown away coming from ps4 at the time. I wasnt. It still looked like some computer artists monster designs on an unreal engine or whatever engine they use environment. If it was a faster frame rate i didnt notice. If it had more something else it barely noticed. The game was the same game. It was boring to me whatever the specs It ran at. 

What i did notice however, and was really shocked he didnt, was the unbelievable jerkiness in horizontal panning. I said i think you need a better monitor or tv to play this through. But he had zero sensitivity too it and just said oh yeah i guess a bit. To me these stutters frames in horizontal panning make most top end TVs practically useless for gaming or sports whereas other people seem to just think its normal to jerk all over the place.. so to speak.could probably have phrased that better.

what i mean is that it comes down to how the game is to play and that encompasses so many things and staring at a specs sheet probably tells you about ten percent of the overall experience Unless you have something way outside of average,

just as an end user experience i found the pissing around in menus forever, then jerky sync and god knows what else issues to make the price tag of a 2000 plus gaming pc seem pointless As its not specs so much as optimisation in my opinion that make the actual gaming experience. Of course if someone‚Äôs sitting looking at gpu ram on a data sheet they dont see that.

this sounds a bit anti pc and i dont mean it it be. If sony go fully digital its unlikely ill ever buy another of their consoles. 

i never really get the whole oh with a pc you can upgrade its so flexible thing. i mean, ok you can get a better gpu etc but that will cost you twice as much as a new console so its a bit disingenuous when this is represented as making pcs better financially. It just means you pay enormous amounts of money to have a faster machine that wont play any more  games than a console, but after two years of the consoles life cycle you‚Äôll see more shadows or something Or it will run in 4k 120 fps. i just find fps to have such minimal impact on gaming outside of the fps multiplayer gamers which is something i have no interest in.

so a console say its 500 in (not the pro). A pc say its 1800 in. Obviously that can be a lot higher. Then paying for 700 gpu after a few years. with the feeling the motherboard wont support newer stuff anyway sometime. I really don‚Äôt understand the comparison.

for me the difference is really which games are available and do i have a smooth gaming experience. console takes care of a lot of stuff that takes time or is a problem on pc.";pcs much less stable console many plus points im sure said though wide range hardware means gaming pc always involve problems stability whereas console everything optimised development hardware console playing software im similar dilemma least think every years feel whole idea getting pc upgrading dont know really big advantage ive gamed high end gaming pcs vs consoles throughout life cycle difference one toward wend life cycle pc gaming shockingly minimal unless need twitch gaming fps strange kind mind bubble exists feel pc community lot reading specs rather actually playing seeing much real world difference make experience pc gamer friends remember playing friends high end pc think iot doom remotely impressed looked console shooters nice reflections meh kept looking thinking id blown away coming ps4 time wasnt still looked like computer artists monster designs unreal engine whatever engine use environment faster frame rate didnt notice something else barely noticed game game boring whatever specs ran notice however really shocked didnt unbelievable jerkiness horizontal panning said think need better monitor tv play zero sensitivity said oh yeah guess bit stutters frames horizontal panning make top end tvs practically useless gaming sports whereas people seem think normal jerk place speakcould probably phrased better mean comes game play encompasses many things staring specs sheet probably tells ten percent overall experience unless something way outside average end user experience found pissing around menus forever jerky sync god knows else issues make price tag 2000 plus gaming pc seem pointless specs much optimisation opinion make actual gaming experience course someones sitting looking gpu ram data sheet dont see sounds bit anti pc dont mean sony go fully digital unlikely ill ever buy another consoles never really get whole oh pc upgrade flexible thing mean ok get better gpu etc cost twice much new console bit disingenuous represented making pcs better financially means pay enormous amounts money faster machine wont play games console two years consoles life cycle youll see shadows something run 4k 120 fps find fps minimal impact gaming outside fps multiplayer gamers something interest console say 500 pro pc say 1800 obviously lot higher paying 700 gpu years feeling motherboard wont support newer stuff anyway sometime really dont understand comparison difference really games available smooth gaming experience console takes care lot stuff takes time problem pc;0.9776;Positivo;2

Was that last part confirmed?  I hear a ton about how the PS5 game boost mode will give us 4K upscaled graphics on old PS4 games, but does that also come with 60fps bloodborne?

If it does, then the value of the PS5 pro becomes *immensely* better.  I dont care about 4K visuals at 30fps - 30fps has shit motion clarity, so you can spruce up those visuals to 8K and it won't mean a great deal to me if I'm constantly moving too much to really enjoy it. 

It it doesn't, then it makes more sense to just take that money, buy a decent graphics card for your existing PC, and open up a much wider library that you can also get VR on.

1ff0pvq;2025-03-06;"Thanks for the reply that was cool to read. I just end up amassing digital games on sales or moments of laziness but generally I‚Äôm disabled with limited income so I prefer to buy and sell on eBay and not really spend much. I do like the convenience of digital stores though.

with regards to the lessening jumps in tech or between generations‚Ä¶ I mean, I remember playing snes games (and Amiga too) and the biggest leap between any generation I think was really to fully 3d games from 2d. Tomb raider on the ps1 and Mario 64. Of course you had 3d pc games but not of that sort, mainly shooters and I can‚Äôt remember where we were with doom, and x wing (which I loved). In all honesty, every single generation since then has been a disappointment to me with the exception of gta 3 on the ps2 and the Wii motion controls in Wii sports. nothing has come close to that expanding into 3 dimensions outside of sims. It was so incredible and felt so impossible at the time when we were so used to 2d worlds.

the whole development cycle has just come to resemble pc boxes incremental upgrades. i really dislike this. Consoles should be special. Maybe those days are gone but the magic of seeing a new gaming machine that wasn‚Äôt just the same components reboxed and rebranded. I wish they‚Äôd bring that back. Nintendo do such a great job of keeping that alive keeping inventive, whether or not they get it right because gaming isn‚Äôt just achieving more of the same but better and faster its imagination, innovation, new things. Some succeed, even if it‚Äôs temporary. Some fail - kinect, vr for the mainstream.

There are some possibilities now outside that standard linear development path. China have just developed the first quantum processor that completely blows away googles attempts. Computing is about to change - we‚Äôve been stuck in that moores law narrowing corridor you describe. With that and AI I expect the next ten to twenty years will represent the biggest changes in computing and gaming. Possibly new forms of media. I really thought we‚Äôd all be streaming everything  - perhaps that will be possible now,

I think the drop in expectations from going 3D and early advances to people excited about whether the same game will run at a faster framerate in 4k or even just the same game in 4k - it‚Äôs not even computing or gaming anymore it‚Äôs about adapting to the quality of your display and I find that to be an absolute nadir in terms of what gaming and creating should be about and what people involved should be aspiring to";thanks reply cool read end amassing digital games sales moments laziness generally im disabled limited income prefer buy sell ebay really spend much like convenience digital stores though regards lessening jumps tech generations mean remember playing snes games amiga biggest leap generation think really fully 3d games 2d tomb raider ps1 mario 64 course 3d pc games sort mainly shooters cant remember doom wing loved honesty every single generation since disappointment exception gta ps2 wii motion controls wii sports nothing come close expanding dimensions outside sims incredible felt impossible time used 2d worlds whole development cycle come resemble pc boxes incremental upgrades really dislike consoles special maybe days gone magic seeing new gaming machine wasnt components reboxed rebranded wish theyd bring back nintendo great job keeping alive keeping inventive whether get right gaming isnt achieving better faster imagination innovation new things succeed even temporary fail kinect vr mainstream possibilities outside standard linear development path china developed first quantum processor completely blows away googles attempts computing change weve stuck moores law narrowing corridor describe ai expect next ten twenty years represent biggest changes computing gaming possibly new forms media really thought wed streaming everything perhaps possible think drop expectations going 3d early advances people excited whether game run faster framerate 4k even game 4k even computing gaming anymore adapting quality display find absolute nadir terms gaming creating people involved aspiring;0.9712;Positivo;1

This was a few years ago when i had a ps4. It was practically no different. Games looked the same. He said settings were higher but negligible when playing. i was shocked by how many games had issues and had to be messed with in menus for ages and still had problems with jerkiness. What he noticed was small changes in fidelity and fps. fps wasnt a thing for me. I have an issue with the focus on it, just personally, as i cannot understand how people think a character in a game that is transparently unreal engine or whatever, that is designed by someone working for that dept of a gaming company, looks better running at a higher frame rate. I couldnt disagree more. it looks bad at a low frame rate but films are run at 24fps mostly and look awfulllll in 60 fps. It isnt just what we are used to but to do with how we interpret images. It‚Äôs different in gaming but seeing in csharper motion resolution how unreal characters and things look doesnt impress me at all. Perhaps that would change with more lifelike graphics but im not sure.

i think everything is back ti front. Visual style art direction etc these are what blow me awya. The best graphics i have ever seen are probably the last guardian. The nimation and the way it‚Äôs rendered so it seems so fluid and.. not digital are just shocking, it feels like a new media at times. And thats relatively old now. Playing a bunch of 120 fps hd unreal engine generic reskinned aaa games.. i dunno its more of the same for me.

i dont mean this to be adversarial btw just my subjective experience and how i feel the console generations got boring in the same way that pc gaming is boring. It‚Äôs just not that exciting getting some more polygons, and frames per second imo. And now its all about 4k frame rate and maybe 8k .. i cant think of anything less impressive than seeing more clearly how unrealistic graphics are

changes should be at the source at the heart of how games are made new innovations in how to build games not incremental upgrades of exactly the same framework. I think the last game that blew me away visually before the last guardian was wind waker

i remember many years ago when gta 3 came out On pc. I read so much about how it ran better on pc of course and looked better. I played it. To me it looked awful. Everything was sharp, the motion wasnt smoothed as it was on console - there may have been an option for this. I think that was to disguise the low frame rate on console but it looked much better. I was talking to a friend who knows nothing about gaming really or specs and he said .. but this one looks better. And i think its as simple as that at times, not saying always, and a lot of the specs focus misses what its supposed to be in service of.

If you ONLY play video games, and for some reason don't need to use a PC at all I can understand it. The moment you do anything that needs a PC AND like to game however there isn't much of a reason to own both. Taking a standard home PC and making it a solid gaming rig that will outperform the current gen consoles is only around $800 more in most cases. The difference being is the PC has upgrade paths, and will stay current with gaming far longer. Also people seem to forget that many components can be carried from one PC build to the next.

You get more for less, and its always smoother for what it is.  It is why i skipped out on building a whole new PC rig when I was about due for one in 2016, when I opted for a PS4 pro, and again in 2021, when I opted for a PS5. 

And VR on PS5 has been phenomenal - but Sony feels like they might be ditching their efforts on it this time.  And the PS5 already plays the PS4 games that could get to 60fps just fine. 

That announcement that you linked doesnt specify enough that it can take games that are capped at 30fps, and uncap it to 60fps.  It just says it is smoother - that can mean that whatever games that had some issues maintaining the capped framerate (I think games like Until Dawn would drop into the mid 50s even on a PS5, IIRC) will be able to smooth out the frames to a constant 60. 

Sony REALLLLLLLLLLLLY needs to confirm that capped games at 30fps can be forced into 60fps (like Bloodborne or Alien Isolation).  If it can, then it speaks to how bad that presentation was.  If it can't, then the PS5 pro isn't as great a value proposition as it should have been.

1ff0pvq;2024-09-13;"I dunno man, theres not really any moral sort of thing or superiority just cos someone cant be arsed doing something do you feel me. I get that consoles are very low effort but that's because everything is sort of decided for you. No effort because no choice, or if there is a choice its often a big trade off. For example I played the dead space remake on Series X and it was choosing between wading through shit at 30fps or playing at 60 and not being able to make any detail out whatsoever because the internal res was so low. In a game as dark as that it was absolutely painful.

Even on my worst day as a pc player, hardest thing I had to deal with was windows auto updating the gpu driver without my consent, in which case I rolled back, because I just dont change if nothing is broken. It's just impossible to frame that an individual is better off not being on PC because its just objectively not true especially if it's based out of laziness. But yanoo hitler had mates and the people rejected Jesus. So ultimately peoples perceptions and biases arent that reliable and ultimately as long as you are truly happy with your situation or machine it's not that deep. But realistically that's rarely the case and thats why console wars exist. On the PC platform people just build what they want and are happy with it or they upgrade.

With consoles peoples sense of pride especially in the sony camp come from other people not being able to play sony games? So it's like the removal of things from other people to bolster their perceived value of their purchase. Its insane. People love to argue about consoles because it's something they've got no control of so no actual action has to be taken. PC you can just build or tinker your way out of anything.

But again each to their own.";dunno man theres really moral sort thing superiority cos someone cant arsed something feel get consoles low effort thats everything sort decided effort choice choice often big trade example played dead space remake series choosing wading shit 30fps playing 60 able make detail whatsoever internal res low game dark absolutely painful even worst day pc player hardest thing deal windows auto updating gpu driver without consent case rolled back dont change nothing broken impossible frame individual better pc objectively true especially based laziness yanoo hitler mates people rejected jesus ultimately peoples perceptions biases arent reliable ultimately long truly happy situation machine deep realistically thats rarely case thats console wars exist pc platform people build want happy upgrade consoles peoples sense pride especially sony camp come people able play sony games like removal things people bolster perceived value purchase insane people love argue consoles something theyve got control actual action taken pc build tinker way anything;0.0842;Positivo;2

The fan and heatsink I believe were not so much the problem, but a catalyst. I recall the problem being poor airflow design, and the console basically choking.

PS+ used to be free until Microsoft proved that charging people to play online became a successful business model. Nintendo online started out as free until they decided to jump on the bandwagon, too. It's greed.

intergrade IS the ps5 version. when you take the ps4 and do your free upgrade, you get integrade.

there is also a dlc called intermission which ps4 owners upgrading to integrade do NOT get, but people buying new copies of intergrade (including people getting intergrade from ps+ extras/premium) DO get.

the reason people are upset is because they want to play the DLC.";anyone help regular version ps5 intergrade ps5 better version regular version ps5 cant find answers anywhere compare ps4 remake ps5 intergrade intergrade ps5 version take ps4 free upgrade get integrade also dlc called intermission ps4 owners upgrading integrade get people buying new copies intergrade including people getting intergrade ps extraspremium get reason people upset want play dlc;0.8402;Positivo;0

k3k53;2011-09-03;"I made a guide on how to get a New Game Plus on Arkham Asylum (but you can only do it on PC since it involves file editing):

Using cheats, you can play the entire game with every upgrade AND every gadget. It involves a little file changing, so you'll want to back up the file you change just in case.

Here's the guide I used though I'll give you what to put in exactly: http://www.cheatbook.de/files/batmanarkhamasylum.htm

Basically go to: Documents\Eidos\Batman Arkham Asylum\BmGame\Config and open BmGame.ini

There's be some code that looks like this (Use Ctrl+F to find it):

DebugLevelStarts=(Name=""FE_NewGame"", LevelNames=""start batentry?Area=Max,Max_C0,Max_C0_Audio,Max_C0_CLights,Max_C0_FX,Max_C0_Lights,Max_C0_Static,Max_A1,Max_A1_Audio,Max_A1_CH1,Max_A1_CLights,Max_A1_Fx,Max_A1_Lights,Max_A1_Static,Max_IntroParty,Max_IntroAudio?Flags=Chapter1_Start,gamestart,Batman_AbilitiesScreenDisabled,Batman_EnvAnalysisDisabled,Batman_RiddlesDisabled,Batman_RiddlerChallengesDisabled?Start=BeginGame?Movie=101_Batmobile_Intro?StreamMovie"")


The lines above and below what you are editing say *ButtonCover=true* and *DebugLevelStarts=(Name=""FE_Continue"", LevelNames=""loadgame"")* don't change those

You'll want to add this at the end in between StreamMovie and "")

?Flags=Unlocked_Health1,Unlocked_Health2,Unlocked_Health3,Unlocked_Health4,Equip_HarpoonGunLv2,Equip_LineLauncher,Equip_ExplosiveGoo,Equip_Resonator2,Unlocked_BatarangStunTime,Unlocked_BatarangTarget2,Unlocked_BatarangTarget3,Unlocked_ExplodeSolo,Unlocked_ProximityMine,Unlocked_SonicBatarang,Unlocked_SonicBatarangExp,Unlocked_ResonatorRange,Unlocked_ResonatorEasy,Unlocked_BatarangSteer,Unlocked_AnytimeTd,Unlocked_FloorGrateTd,Unlocked_GlassSmashTd,Unlocked_HangAttackTd,Unlocked_CombatThrow,Unlocked_QuickTakedown,Unlocked_DoublePowerCombo,Unlocked_LedgeGrab,Unlocked_ComboBatarang,Unlocked_ComboBoost

So it'll look like: ..StreamMovie?Flags=Unlocked_Health1..."")

You still have the intro where you can only walk, but once you start the actual game, you'll have everything.

NOTE: Once I started, I only had the upgrades not the gadgets, I had to Restart from Checkpoint to get them

Full new code looks like this:

DebugLevelStarts=(Name=""FE_NewGame"", LevelNames=""start batentry?Area=Max,Max_C0,Max_C0_Audio,Max_C0_CLights,Max_C0_FX,Max_C0_Lights,Max_C0_Static,Max_A1,Max_A1_Audio,Max_A1_CH1,Max_A1_CLights,Max_A1_Fx,Max_A1_Lights,Max_A1_Static,Max_IntroParty,Max_IntroAudio?Flags=Chapter1_Start,gamestart,Batman_AbilitiesScreenDisabled,Batman_EnvAnalysisDisabled,Batman_RiddlesDisabled,Batman_RiddlerChallengesDisabled?Start=BeginGame?Movie=101_Batmobile_Intro?StreamMovie?Flags=Unlocked_Health1,Unlocked_Health2,Unlocked_Health3,Unlocked_Health4,Equip_HarpoonGunLv2,Equip_LineLauncher,Equip_ExplosiveGoo,Equip_Resonator2,Unlocked_BatarangStunTime,Unlocked_BatarangTarget2,Unlocked_BatarangTarget3,Unlocked_ExplodeSolo,Unlocked_ProximityMine,Unlocked_SonicBatarang,Unlocked_SonicBatarangExp,Unlocked_ResonatorRange,Unlocked_ResonatorEasy,Unlocked_BatarangSteer,Unlocked_AnytimeTd,Unlocked_FloorGrateTd,Unlocked_GlassSmashTd,Unlocked_HangAttackTd,Unlocked_CombatThrow,Unlocked_QuickTakedown,Unlocked_DoublePowerCombo,Unlocked_LedgeGrab,Unlocked_ComboBatarang,Unlocked_ComboBoost"")


**WARNING** Because you aren't supposed to play the game like this, some problems can occur. Most can be fixed if you do Restart from Checkpoint (going through a vent and falling into blackness etc). One problem I had was I used the cryptographic sequencer right before you are supposed to get it. This locked the gate, and didn't let me access the cutscene. Just Restart. HOWEVER, I found an actual problem.

It's just that it's taken PSN being down to really drive that point home and I'm tired of just taking it. Maybe I shouldn't have posted this on r/playstation because this isn't really just Playstation/Sony's fault. It's an industry wide issue.

Perhaps a lot of people are having hissy fits but lots of these are kids and so it's normal. I'm just a tired as almost middle aged gamer who remember the good ol days. Sure technology is a lot better these days but boy do we get the short end of the stick sometimes.

Battery dead in your phone? Pay $200 to get a new one installed. Back in my day, we just bought a spare battery for like $20 and slotted it in. Apply justified this by saying that it affects the IP rating to have replaceable batteries but this wasn't true, other manufacturers has swappable batteries and still had high IP ratings.

Battery dead in your electric car? It's not worthless and you have to pay $20k to get a new battery. What the actual heck? So a car's lifetime is just 10 years now? Isn't that crazy? How are these batteries not designed to be easily swapped out. If the Chinese manufacturers can do it, why can't we do it?

Australia Tax is a phrase applied to the generally higher prices in Australia of goods and services than equivalent costs in comparative overseas nations such as the United States. This is particularly the case for video games, computer hardware, and software but may extend to non-technological items such as cars, designer clothing and banking services. Companies selling non-physical products which are not subject to the rent and labour of a traditional retail outlet have been particularly criticised. Some prices differences can be as much as 88%.

Sometimes MS runs specials with double point days, they give out free credits on holidays, and they'll often run specials on redeeming for MS/Xbox digital gift cards. For example, right now you can get $5/$10 for only 3,500/7,000 points instead of 5,000/10,000. They even offer Amazon and other store gift cards as well which I've even used to buy Switch games.

83vqyh;2018-03-12;"Your Sony one is slightly inaccurate.

Their credit card is 5 points per dollar spent when you link your card to the Playstation Network account. In the past, it was 10 points, and some people are still grandfathered in. It just gets 1% extra at Sony stores and products.

They also offer 3x-5x points on special sales on Playstation Network. The flash sale they had last weekend offered 5x points. So you can get up to ten points when you purchase something on the flash sale on the credit card. Credit card has no fees, so it's basically free, and as far as I'm aware, the bonus points from sale do not require PS+. The extra 1% back helps though. So that's 5% you can get back for free and on certain sales, sometimes even 8-10%, and all you need is just a gift card.

I'd also point out that if you're going to use the cost of 15% off eShop cards, that Microsoft (and to a lesser extent) Sony have the same deals on their gift cards. So we should assume everyone is spending directly without gift cards. Xbox gift cards have been on sale about 3-4 times in February for about 15% off as well, so it's not uncommon.

Nintendo is the most simple and straightforward for the consumer, but if anyone plays/spends a lot on Xbox/Playstation already, Nintendo's reward system isn't anything special, and in some cases, can even be worse than the competition. Microsoft has myVIP gems which give additional rewards (I got $25 reward credit for playing Xbox games in 2017) and Sony is rewarding people for collecting trophies, (which I claimed $15 in reward credit for my trophies since the program started in late 2017).

Another thing to add for Best Buy is the $10 pre-order certificate on certain games.

In terms of total cost of ownership (not covered in my post) physical still beats digital in most cases. Digital can get the 5% return and it isn't difficult to get 15% off an eShop card, making any game a 20% discount (15% now, 5% for the next game). An eShop discount will add on to that, but that's the end of your savings options.  

You can get physical games for 20% off easy (Amazon Prime and pre-order or Best Buy's GCU for $15/year). Plus you get 1% back from Nintendo, so basically 21% with a little effort. Then add in retail sales. Best Buy puts games on sale, and the GCU discount stacks on top of that. Not to mention Black Friday specials. Then there is the resell value. Zelda is a game most will keep a long time, but Odyssey may be a one and done for non-completionists.

I fully admit (just like u/kaiush said) that Nintendo's system is probably the best for consumer in general because of the ease of use. Microsoft and Sony both require using another website, as well as doing challenges/missions for additional rewards. However, it is not too difficult to reach 6% with Microsoft if you have Gold, or get 3-5% with Sony even if you don't have their credit card.


By virtue of posting on a video gaming subreddit, most of us are in the hardcore catagory of gamers. I'm sure it's more likely we can get these additional rewards compared to the average gamer, which means Nintendo's program can actually be the least rewarding.

I also admit I speak of all of this from a digital perspective. In terms of physical, here's some stuff I see. Nintendo is only valid for 1 year (two in europe) and it's 1%. If you're smart enough with borrowing/renting games and completing xbox challenges (there are xbox missions that can be achieved in several free 2 play games) or sony trophies, you can actually earn more without spending more. At most, Nintendo games will give 60 cents back, since it'll mostly cap out at 60 cents for a 60 dollar game. And that's if nobody's claimed the reward. But with playstation trophies, you can get ten dollars for every platinum trophy you achieve (most games have one trophy). That means you can get a dollar per game. There is only a cap of doing this six times a year, and no expiration date. It works even on Playstation 3 or Vita games. Plus you get a few bucks for a bunch of silver/gold trophies as well.

I got $25 dollars through the Xbox MyVIP gems program just for my activity in 2017 which is free. To achieve that, physically with Nintendo games, you would have to spend $2,500 on physical games. Even with GCU discount and tax, that comes to $2,100.";appreciate math try make sure correct numbers otherwise unfair comparison fully admit like ukaiush said nintendos system probably best consumer general ease use microsoft sony require using another website well challengesmissions additional rewards however difficult reach microsoft gold get 35 sony even dont credit card virtue posting video gaming subreddit us hardcore catagory gamers im sure likely get additional rewards compared average gamer means nintendos program actually least rewarding also admit speak digital perspective terms physical heres stuff see nintendo valid year two europe youre smart enough borrowingrenting games completing xbox challenges xbox missions achieved several free play games sony trophies actually earn without spending nintendo games give 60 cents back since itll mostly cap 60 cents 60 dollar game thats nobodys claimed reward playstation trophies get ten dollars every platinum trophy achieve games one trophy means get dollar per game cap six times year expiration date works even playstation vita games plus get bucks bunch silvergold trophies well got 25 dollars xbox myvip gems program activity 2017 free achieve physically nintendo games would spend 2500 physical games even gcu discount tax comes 2100;0.9852;Positivo;4

They had to eat the dissatisfaction of early adopters not having the new conversion rates to make that system effective and easy to use. Because let's be real: Did anyone use the gold coins for the discounts? I can sure tell I didn't - it was weird as I had to look on an external page for a discounted game I wanted to buy, buy it and then buy the game on the system/Nintendo main page.

One way of looking at it is this: a lot of people *did* own other Nintendo consoles, but weren't really focused on buying new games for their 3DS or Wii U when they have a shiny Switch to buy for. Those deals on other platforms encouraged folks to use their Switch purchases for discounts on worthwhile games on their other platforms. The rewards program is ultimately there to make them more money (for example: encouraging buying digitally), not really undercut their profits for your satisfaction.

I would also try going to ps5 support and asking them for the reason it was banned. It may be a temporary ban and you'll have to wait it out.

k6chg1;2023-10-10;"I am totally new to gaming. I used to play back in the day and haven't for like 15yrs. Less then a yr ago a friend bought me the 5 with 2k23 and fifa2023. Ioved the basketball a ton and it was late in the nba season so the time I got good on it the new 1come out. I went to Wallmart and purchased it as soon as I could and couldn't wait to come home and play with the new Rosters and Victor Wembemyama I was pumped. Had to wait well over an hour for it to download. I'm 54yo and I am not a computer whiz by any means. I am in the category of a disgrace when it comes to comp.skllls. anyways I finally get on and I love the my career mode. You need V.C. to build your player. Now at the store they told me that I could get 2k24 $60 or the edition of black mamba $105 and main reason I got the mamba one was because it came with 100k v.c.it took me 45mins just to find where to put this code that he told me to punch in to get the v.c. . I put it in and it only gives me 2k v.c. I thought maybe I did it wrong or i pt it in wrong spot and went searching. It said somewhere click here for your v.c. or v c. Who knows I click in. It shows like 5 diffrent options of v.c. now I didn't want to hit the button because I was nervous of a charge and I said to myself they didn't give me mine so maybe it's there., but I was like I hope I do not get charged. 
I said but there should be a last confirmation ask. Are u sure u want to purchase blah blah. Like a yes no final ask...so I hit it.BOOM thank you for your purchase.  and it was a 50 buck for 200k v.c. I immediately left a note in the game , it has an ask question option.Next day i tried to get in touch with Playstation rep. Waited an hr. He said it wasn't the department, he said he would transfer me another hour later it just disconnected..2 days go by I try it again. This time it asked if I want a call back instead of waiting in line I applied for tht. NO PHONE CALL...3 more days pass. I try to email them it bounces back to me.  So I call my c.c. comp.and tell them I hit the button by mistake and I can't get in touch with them. That's was it.. i forgot from there. 3weeks later I get suspended. I had no clue why or how or what. It took me hrs to get down to it and find out it was from tht day. By some miracle and serious persistence,  like relentlessly I waited and got lucky and got someone on the phone. I ask why? He said pay it or u will be permanently banned. I said u want to bully me into buying something tht I never wanted. I say , Ok so I pay u now then what? What about the 100k I didnt get when I bought the game, im sure u can see i never recieved it  He tells me go to Wal-Mart. I says,  what the cashier? Are u kidding me or what. So I go ok you win,  let me pay it now then, bcause i want to play a game. He says I can't pay now I have to get a voucher (spoke very broken English and I'm from Brooklyn) I haven't a clue what a voucher even is. It drove me crazy no knowing what I was supposed to do amd finally I figure it out last nite. I buy the gift card.i put the numbers in the spot on the site. I also found 2 pieces of paper in the cartridge of the game with numbers on it. I go back to Playstation.com and put that in as well. All excepted. And still no email. No suspension lifted , Nothing! . This is oit of control. I've never once bought any kind of add on , or anything for a game period. I Iike to work for it. It's the fun part of the game. Not to mention every button u press brings u to a page to charge ur card and im always affraid I can hit wrong button and get charged. I want it so I can not buy anything. That it has to be verified by me if anything. This is total bullsht. The audacity.  The Customer is no longer always right , the customer is a mark and a nuisance and if he's not a robot that gets walked all over. Hes gone. How can a company sustain with these policy's.

When they did finally get back to me, they told me they could not find any issues with my case. They said that my console and psn were both fine. I was super frustrated with this response, and as a last ditch effort I told them to compare the serial number of the console I received to the one they have on file. It turned out that they did not match up, so they unbanned my console right there and then, but it should be noted that they would have not solved my issue if I did not mention the serial numbers.;yes chatted playstation direct support contacted first time told would look issue would get back week finally get back told could find issues case said console psn fine super frustrated response last ditch effort told compare serial number console received one file turned match unbanned console right noted would solved issue mention serial numbers;0.8442;Positivo;1

No more excuses. Full emulation should be present in any modern console within the realms of possibility in order to play previous games of the preceding console family. I understand it may not be possible for the PS3 because of it's unique circumstances but I fully expect the PS5 to play PS4 discs flawlessly. 

2. Classics on the Playstation Store. 

There's so many PS1 and PS2 classics available to buy digitally for PS3, what the hell happened to PS4? There's almost nothing. Why? Because they'd rather remake the classics instead of put the remasters or original games for cheap? That's what it seems like, and it's pretty scummy.

3. PS4 extended customization.

Right now, the only icon that gets added to your profile is the Platinum trophy if you get it. That‚Äôs nice, but platinums are generally achieved by less than 10% of players, some games significantly less than that.

To make trophies more accessible to other players, I‚Äôd like to see some kind of recognition (perhaps a star added to your profile) if you complete a game.

I have neither the time nor the inclination to replay TLOU following a guide to collect stupid dog tags, or Uncharted 4 to collect pointless treasures, or GTA 5 to fly under bridges.

Some are due to hackers and they use a tool that kickes players off the psn network. Ability to block players from joining your party is a must.  Test Update: Blocked players must be added to the message group in order to join. Also as a woman I do get harassed quite a bit and the ability to block is needed. Sure I can report it now but I need a way of making sure I never see that individual again in a party.  

- No quick ability to kick someone from party for above reason. - If message creator gets offline there is zero way to moderate the party.  

- Mute is one sided. Muted party member can still hear you. So many issues with this one. I play with 8 friends each night. Muting allowed for a quick private conversation without having to leave the party. We also have different political views and sometimes discussions can get heated. Before I go offending people with different views we would mute and hold different convos in the same party. But we are all still friends and might be queued for a match so starting a separate party is out of the question.  

- Not able to start a party by myself and have others join if they wish. Means I‚Äôm thrown into world chat on many games with no way to mute people in that game. Makes some games unplayable. Examples would be ARK and ESO.  

- Join game session from party no longer works.  

- SharePlay can‚Äôt be started for anyone in the party to join. You must invite one person from the party. No more having it open for the friend waiting to join in on the next round.  

- Anyone can change the message group name. If my idiot friend renames it ‚Äún word‚Äù, will I be banned just for bing in the message group?

To Create A Party

I can't see anyone's chat parties anymore, because I'm not in any of their groups that they've created. And they can't see mine unless I specifically add their name to the group. This essentially makes everyone's chat parties private by default. 

You can't kick people out of parties anymore. You have to leave the group, make a new group, and have everyone re-join. 

Also, I can't send friends multiple invites, I can only send them one. If I want to re invite someone, maybe after a game match or something, I have to delete them from the group and re add them. What sense does that make? 

My message box is now full of past groups I've created, so I have to sift through those to find actual conversations I'm having with people via messages.. 

I used to be able to make a party by myself, I would do this sometimes just as an easy way to mute everyone from the game. Now if I wanted to do that, I have to create a group to make a party, which means I have to invite at least one person to create a party intended for myself. Dumb

And they took away joining people's games from the party, and the play together invite option. Now I have to rely on activision's God awful friends list, or spend 5 minutes loading someone's profile to join their game.

So it's worth mentioning that the report process still needs to be initiated by someone in the party. If you're playing with friends and everything being said is mutually acceptable, I'd assume nobody is reporting anybody, so in that case it's a non-issue.

If you're playing with friends but also bring someone else into the group who you do not know well, and they do take offense to something being said and reports it.... then, it depends with the amount of context is used. I would guess Sony would err on the side of ruling AGAINST homophobia, for example, but I can't say how they would rule. Audio reporting hasn't been done yet on PSN so this is a new thing for the service.

Listen, I get people having their own sense of humour and all that, but I also think that there probably should be some level of decency involved here. Maybe this is an unpopular take (and fair enough if it is) but if you're playing with people you don't know, you probably shouldn't be saying shit that is widely viewed as homophobic, racist, threatening, etc. I think it's just a ""consideration for other people"" sort of thing.

Party Chat audio previously could have been recorded on a PS4 via:

* PS4 SHARE functions, if players opted in to allow their voice to be recorded for parties.
* Someone using a capture card/device on their PS4, regardless of user consent.

Sony will not be listening in when they want. Instead, PS5 users can now report Party Voice Chat content. When a report is made, that user is able to submit a recording of voice chat (no details on how long the recording is yet) to Sony, at which point it gets reviewed.

It was never previously possible (and technically still isn't on PS4) to send AUDIO content as a report. Before it was only text and visual content (messages, profile content, etc.)

As for how Sony is going to find the time/resources, I have a few speculations:

* This report system may be used less often than we think. Many parties are created by friends who know each other, and many folks won't be bothered to report everything they hear.
* For those that do, those who start clearly abusing the report system may be suspended, lighting the load
* Sony may outsource this with a company that specializes in this type of service.

Actually you brought up ***two*** really good points.

1. **The unchallenged stereotype that gamers and gaming communities are toxic. -** For some reason this has gone on forever and just taken as an article of faith. ""Gamers are toxic! That's just the way it is!"". I don't know what set us down this path, but it could very well be because there have never been systems like this that lead to repercussions. People like to complain that gaming communities are so toxic, but perhaps it's because stuff like this has always gone unchecked
2. **Helping curb and shutdown trolls / toxic players** \- Like you said, it's sometimes been common practice that players could lose a match, invite you to a party and then say some hateful shit. I think these will be CLEAR CUT examples of ToS violations, and if this is the habit that dies from a result of this addition then honestly I can welcome that with open arms.

Maybe I'm speaking hyperbole here, but I think moments like this can very well be paradigm shifts as to how gaming communities define themselves. Are gamers on PSN going to just be ""toxic just because that's the way it is?"" or can we actually do something about it and make it a better experience for people.

I do understand that there is some gray area: dark or inappropriate humor is a thing, we see it in comedy all of the time, but I also think there's a difference between solicited and unsolicited.

If this gets people to think ""hey I'm with friends I can say whatever shit I like"" and then when playing with strangers they think ""I should probably be mindful of other people I'm playing with""... then maybe the world of gaming has made a meaningful step forward of being less toxic.

This isn't a mystery: ""am I offending someone?"" though. In fact 'offending someone' is not alone against the ToS of PSN. As you say, when someone gets offended varies from person to person.

If you misgender someone by accident (you say ""she"" instead of ""he"") and someone is offended by that, that alone still doesn't constitute a violation of the ToS even if you are reported.

If you misgender someone, they correct you and ask for you to use the pronouns they use, and then you follow up with a bunch of harassment and identity-based hate speech NOW you've violated the ToS.

Of course. On PSN though you're using Sony's service. They in part feel responsible for the experience people have on it, and they should. Playing basketball outside is likely either in a public space or on someone's private property.

jbfzo0;2020-10-17;">I‚Äôm not going to start asking people what pronouns I should use for them as you suggest

My post ***never*** suggested or implied that you need to be asking for people's pronouns. I don't know how you got that impression. My language choice was clear, if I was suggesting you needed to, I would have said that.

On the contrary: I said that even ***if*** you used the wrong pronoun for someone and that person was offended by that, you still likely wouldn't have violated any ToS or be suspended even if reported. Using an incorrect pronoun doesn't violate the ToS.

However let's say the conversation continues: Let's assume that person asks you to use their preferred pronouns instead.

If you say ""yeah... I won't be doing that"", you **STILL** likely haven't violated any ToS. If you read through the Code of Conduct you haven't done anything that violates any of that.

If you instead go into a tirade that starts insulting, harassing, and personally attacking them based on their sex/gender/identity. Then yes, ***now*** you have violated the ToS and, if reported, would probably have action taken against you.

Obviously I don't work for Sony, but going off of the code of conduct as reference, which is what Sony is using too, it's pretty clear to me. Nobody is asking you to ask for people's pronouns each time you play with someone new.";im going start asking people pronouns use suggest post never suggested implied need asking peoples pronouns dont know got impression language choice clear suggesting needed would said contrary said even used wrong pronoun someone person offended still likely wouldnt violated tos suspended even reported using incorrect pronoun doesnt violate tos however lets say conversation continues lets assume person asks use preferred pronouns instead say yeah wont still likely havent violated tos read code conduct havent done anything violates instead go tirade starts insulting harassing personally attacking based sexgenderidentity yes violated tos reported would probably action taken obviously dont work sony going code conduct reference sony using pretty clear nobody asking ask peoples pronouns time play someone new;0.9252;Positivo;3
jbfzo0;2020-10-19;">But you are arguing for what could be as well,

I'm absolutely not.

I'm arguing for what is **currently**. Unless you're trying to say I'm ""assuming your assumption is not true"" which sounds like circular reasoning to me... or something of that nature. Your predictions should not be assumed to come true, nor should mine. I don't think I've made many assumptions, other than the Xbox thing (which I comment on below)

Quite literally **I am not assuming anything**. I am looking at the confirmed information. I am not saying what you suggest is impossible nor I am not saying it definitely will happen\*\*.\*\* What I ***am*** doing, is not considering what you suggest as a factor right now because currently, in the present, it is not a real thing.

***If*** it becomes a real thing, like I said: I'll gladly have that argument again and likely would take your side.

>you have no idea what the ins and outs of what they are going to do.

Of course I don't, and if the policies change then we'll have this conversation again based on its own merits, like I said.

>You are assuming everything is above board and perfect

Again, I'm not assuming anything. My responses are based on the confirmed information.

>you have no idea and no affiliation, no law degree.

This doesn't make my opinion invalid does it? I acknowledge that I cannot predict the future, I am not affiliated with Sony so I cannot speak on behalf of them officially, and yes I am not a lawyer. I'd be lying if I said otherwise on any of those points.

This doesn't mean I can't point out that I find it unreasonable to argue hypotheticals though.

Listen, I understand you are concerned about the potential way it could go, and that's fair enough. That doesn't mean that it is an issue now though.

>As far as im aware xbox(microsoft) did not passively record party and game chats at all times, which is what you are claiming, I'd live to see it.

You misunderstood what I wrote. On the contrary I am claiming that Xbox has ***not*** passively recorded audio chats, nor have they even accepted audio recordings as evidence for conduct reports to my understanding. My point is despite being able to report players without any audio evidence or context (and thus prone to report abuse) it has not been a significant problem among the Xbox community it seems. This is why I do not believe some version of this for PlayStation will be an issue either. *(there's my assumption if you were looking for it - keep in mind it is an assumption of a hypothetical! We may not even ever need to worry about this)*";arguing could well im absolutely im arguing currently unless youre trying say im assuming assumption true sounds like circular reasoning something nature predictions assumed come true mine dont think ive made many assumptions xbox thing comment quite literally assuming anything looking confirmed information saying suggest impossible saying definitely happen considering suggest factor right currently present real thing becomes real thing like said ill gladly argument likely would take side idea ins outs going course dont policies change well conversation based merits like said assuming everything board perfect im assuming anything responses based confirmed information idea affiliation law degree doesnt make opinion invalid acknowledge predict future affiliated sony speak behalf officially yes lawyer id lying said otherwise points doesnt mean cant point find unreasonable argue hypotheticals though listen understand concerned potential way could go thats fair enough doesnt mean issue though far im aware xboxmicrosoft passively record party game chats times claiming id live see misunderstood wrote contrary claiming xbox passively recorded audio chats even accepted audio recordings evidence conduct reports understanding point despite able report players without audio evidence context thus prone report abuse significant problem among xbox community seems believe version playstation issue either theres assumption looking keep mind assumption hypothetical may even ever need worry;0.6908;Positivo;1

The longer version:

""on a rolling contract"" and then talk about a ""yearly upgrade"" -- so we can assume you are on a 1 or 3 month subscription with auto-renew enabled (which it is by default). You can't convert from one subscription length (1 or 3 month) to another (12 month). You need to turn off auto-renew and let your current subscription end. You can then create a new subscription at the annual/12 month length at whatever level you want. Since you would be creating a new subscription, you should get the Days of Play discount since you say that would be on June 7th (and Days of Play goes until the 11th).

If you have a 12-month contract already and want the Days of Play discount, you have to do the same thing as the discount does not apply for renewals just new subscriptions.

Separately, you can upgrade (but not downgrade) your subscription. The cost is the prorated difference between tiers for the length of time remaining on the subscription. You say you had Essential and upgraded to Premium, so yes, the Days of Play discount applied for that upgrade.

If you want to downgrade it's the same {cancel auto-renew, current subscription expires, create new subscription} method as described above.";tldr seems youve figured yes longer version rolling contract talk yearly upgrade assume month subscription autorenew enabled default cant convert one subscription length month another 12 month need turn autorenew let current subscription end create new subscription annual12 month length whatever level want since would creating new subscription get days play discount since say would june 7th days play goes 11th 12month contract already want days play discount thing discount apply renewals new subscriptions separately upgrade downgrade subscription cost prorated difference tiers length time remaining subscription say essential upgraded premium yes days play discount applied upgrade want downgrade cancel autorenew current subscription expires create new subscription method described;0.9538;Positivo;3
